# Firebase Shopping List App

This repository contains a simple and straightforward shopping list application built with Firebase. You can access the live application [here](https://huseyinkaplan00.github.io/Firebase-Shopping-List-App/).

## Features
- **Add Items:** Users can add items to the shopping list by entering the name into an input field and clicking on the add button.
- **Delete Items:** Users can remove items from the list by clicking on them. The deletion reflects in real-time on the Firebase database.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The list updates in real-time across all connected devices, thanks to Firebase's real-time database.
- **Random Backgrounds:** The app fetches a random 'note' themed photo from the Unsplash API at every launch, providing a unique visual experience each time.

## Tech Stack
- **Firebase:** Used for its real-time database, hosting the list data and ensuring sync across all devices.
- **Unsplash API:** Used to fetch random images that serve as backgrounds for the app.
